# simple-git-feature-branch-workflow

## About

This project provides a few git aliases to help with the [Git Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).

From the Atlassian website:

> The core idea behind the Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the **master** branch. This encapsulation makes it easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase. It also means the **master** branch will never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for continuous integration environments.

## Prerequisites

These aliases should work in any *NIX based OS (Linux, macOS, WSL ?Â¿?) with git installed, anyway, the complete list of used commands is:

* awk
* cat
* cut
* echo
* git
* grep
* sed
* tr
* xargs

## Install

  1. Get this repo:

      ```text
      git clone https://github.com/jobace78/simple-git-feature-branch-workflow.git
      ```

  2. Update your configuration:

      Edit your `~/.gitconfig` file with something like this:

      ```text
      [include]
        path = ~/simple-git-feature-branch-workflow/gitconfig.d/auto.inc
        path = ~/simple-git-feature-branch-workflow/gitconfig.d/auto-dry-run.inc
        path = ~/simple-git-feature-branch-workflow/gitconfig.d/feature-abort.inc
        path = ~/simple-git-feature-branch-workflow/gitconfig.d/feature-begin.inc
        path = ~/simple-git-feature-branch-workflow/gitconfig.d/feature-clean.inc
        path = ~/simple-git-feature-branch-workflow/gitconfig.d/feature-continue.inc
        path = ~/simple-git-feature-branch-workflow/gitconfig.d/feature-list.inc
        path = ~/simple-git-feature-branch-workflow/gitconfig.d/feature-to-master.inc
        path = ~/simple-git-feature-branch-workflow/gitconfig.d/feature-to-next.inc
        path = ~/simple-git-feature-branch-workflow/gitconfig.d/feature-where-is.inc
        path = ~/simple-git-feature-branch-workflow/gitconfig.d/publish-feature.inc
        path = ~/simple-git-feature-branch-workflow/gitconfig.d/publish-master.inc
        path = ~/simple-git-feature-branch-workflow/gitconfig.d/publish-next.inc
      ```

## Usage

We'll create a "sandbox" to play safe:

```shell
cd /tmp || exit 1 && \
git init --bare test.git && \
git clone test.git test && \
cd test && \
git config user.email example@example.org && \
echo '# test' > README.md && \
git add README.md && \
git commit -m "Initial commit" && \
git push --set-upstream origin master && \
git remote set-head origin master
```

  1. *Begin* a new feature:

      ```shell
      git feature-begin WIP-1
      ```

  2. Add something:

      ```shell
      echo 'test' > test.txt
      git add test.txt
      git auto
      ```

  3. *Push* (A.K.A. publish) the local **feature** branch into **remote/origin**:

      ```shell
      git publish-feature WIP-1
      ```

  4. *Merge* (A.K.A. integrate) the feature in the local **master** branch:

      ```shell
      git feature-to-master WIP-1
      ```

  5. *Push* (A.K.A. publish) the local **master** branch into **remote/origin**:

      ```shell
      git publish-master
      ```

## Notes

  1. If you find any problem during the merge operation (git feature-to-next, git feature-to-master) you can abort at any time with `git feature-abort`.

  2. The merge operation (git feature-to-next, git feature-to-master) does not have a strict order (regarding other branches), but is advisable to merge a branch in a short space of time and **next** should be merged before **master**.

  3. You can check if a branch has been already merged with `git feature-where-is <feature branch name>`.
